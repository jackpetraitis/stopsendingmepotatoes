===========

A website build with Ember, Node, and MySQL

Installation
============

Download Node and NPM. Run npm install and hopefully it will get gulp for you. 


Web API
=======

This website project also includes a RESTful web API written in Node using Express. I have plans on attacking my own website and buffering its security defenses for XSRF, XSS, injection, etc later on. That is why the server API source code is not included in this public repository. Once it is safe I will add it to the repo.

Tests
=====

This website was built from an Ember starter-kit and therefore includes some QUnit test framework. I haven't written any tests for this website but I imagine most of them will be on the backend testing the framework. I haven't decided on the usefulness of having some front end tests yet.
